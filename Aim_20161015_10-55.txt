Team - X:

ROI -> Regions of Interest

Aim:
Broad aim: convert CT dicom structure sets (ROI) into 3D objects that can be visulaised as surfaces


* Object representation of ROIs in dicom co-ordinate system
* Surface rendering of ROIS (Lung L1, Lung R1, Target, etc)
* See dose in each ROI
* Turn on/off each ROI when visualising
* If target dose changes, what does the dose look like to the other ROIs?
* nominate centre of rotation for 3D datasets
